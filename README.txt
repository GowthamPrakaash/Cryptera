 Countdowns are great to get your customers pumped up for an upcoming sale or event. I needed a clock for a Black Friday sale, but most of the clock libraries I found were either ugly or difficult to use. I stumbled across FlipClock.js, which blew the rest of the libraries out of the water. It had a gorgeous interface (that can be customized!), a simple API, and a drop-in JS file that just… worked. It offers the ability to countdown, but requires the parameter in seconds. This made it difficult to have a countdown to a date in the future, so I had to find a way to calculate the “seconds” from the time someone loads a page to the desired date. Enter Countdown.js, which calculates the difference between any two dates. Combining these two libraries is super simple!
